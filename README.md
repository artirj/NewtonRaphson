# NRaphson
This is a code to calculate solutions to nonlinear equations in multiple variables using the Newton-Raphson algorithm
It uses matrix/vector classes to make the main function more readable, and uses an iterative algorithm to calculate matrix inverses.

## TODO
* ~~Implement a real inverse matrix calculator~~
* ~~Generalise the code beyond two variables~~
* Calculate all of the roots in an interval
